# Graph-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning
* A repo devoted to all things Graph Data Science and Machine Learning.
* Including but not limited to:
1. Knowledge Graphs
2. Graph Databases
3. Graph Analytics and Algorithms
4. Graph Machine Learning and Neural Networks
5. GraphRAG and AI applications


# What are Graphs?
* Graphs are a way to model a network of interconnected objects, topics, people, things, the list goes on.
* Graphs are commonly used in computer science as data structures consisting of:
  * sets of nodes (vertices/points)
  * sets of relationships (edges/links)
 

# What are Graph Databases?
* Graph DBs are designed to store graph based structures for data modeling and semantic queries of the existing nodes, relationships and properties (attributes).
* Popular Graph database formats include:
  1. RDF
  2. LPG (labeled property graph)
 

# What Graphs are NOT
* Graphs are not charts or plots. Although the term is used interchangebly it is not the same thing in Data Science, Machine Learning and Computer Science. 

# Types of Graphs
1. Undirected
   * Edges do not have orientation.
2. Directed
   * Edges have orientation.
3. Weighted
   * Edges have assigned numeric values. 
4. Multigraph
   * Two nodes may be connected by more than one edge. 
5. Bipartite
    * Nodes are divided into two disjoint sets, and all relationships connect nodes from different sets. Bipartite graphs are often used to model relationships between two distinct types of entities, such as users and products, students and courses, or employees and skills. They are particularly useful in applications like recommendation systems or matching problems.
6. Cyclic
    * Have at least one cycle, which is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
7. Acyclic
    * No cycles are present. 
8. ....there are a lot more....
